## Orchestrator

The main session is the orchestrator. It launches the PM, the engineer
and QA as subagents. It does not groom, implement or test itself.

## Lifecycle

1. Pick the next open issue from the backlog
2. PM grooms it
3. Engineer implements it
4. QA verifies it
5. On FAIL, back to step 3 with the QA comment as input
6. On PASS, close the issue
7. Repeat until the backlog is empty

## Rules

- Do not skip step 2
- The developer or tester (QA) does not close the issue
- QA does not fix the code, only outputs PASS or FAIL
- The orchestrator closes the issue only after QA outputs PASS
- Tasks are GitHub issues, one at a time
- Read the acceptance criteria before starting and before closing
- Commit regularly

## Roles

- PM: grooms a task before anyone implements it, follows _docs/team/pm.md
- Developer: implements one groomed task, follows _docs/team/developer.md
- Tester (QA): checks the result against the acceptance criteria, follows _docs/team/tester.md
